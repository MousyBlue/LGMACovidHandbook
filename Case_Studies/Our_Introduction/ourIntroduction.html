The biggest impact to our community by far was the ongoing state border closures. During these times of uncertainty, the community turned to Council for guidance, leadership and reassurance.Under the collaborative leadership of our Mayor, the Honourable Councillor Lawrence Springborg AM, Local Disaster Management Group and the executive team of Council we successfully navigated the ever-changing environment that was to become our “new normal” and managed to not only survive in the face of adversity but thrive and innovate. We were the first Council to implement cutting-edge Bluetooth e-gate technology on remote state border crossings and received the Butch Lenton Bush Council Innovation Award for our efforts. Our residents led the charge with the highest per capita vaccination rate in Queensland, lending us to become known as “Fortress Goondiwindi”; and as a Council we successfully advocated for financial support for local businesses who had been impacted by border closures.<br></p><img class="infoPortraits" src="photos/goondiwindi.jpg" alt="Portrait of Carl Manton"><p>I am proud of the work we did during the pandemic – our processes and innovative thinking have become the benchmark for how challenges of this nature could be managed in the future."</i><br><small>Written by Chief Executive Officer, Carl Manton</small></p>';

There was no manual for leading through a pandemic and no standard operating procedure laying out how we should respond. Being the closest level of government to the people, we did what we know best – put our people first, community and staff. This helped guide our decision-making and complemented the disaster management framework we used to respond to the situation.<br>I am incredibly proud of our Council team for handling the response in the Isaac region.
