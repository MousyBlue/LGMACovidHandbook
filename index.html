      In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic reached Australiaâ€™s shores and caused significant disruption throughout the country.  Few organisations had plans for a pandemic of this nature, duration and scale and government, business and community alike grappled with the impacts.<br><br>
      For Queensland local governments, capacity to respond effectively and appropriately varied depending on a range of factors.  This handbook seeks to identify the approaches and processes which let to the most optimal outcomes for council and their communities and to capture the lessons leant from the pandemic response so that future councils can be better prepared.<br><br>
      This analysis was commissioned by LGMA, the professional body for local government officers in  Queensland, and undertaken by Gary Stevenson of Stevenson Consulting.  Gary is a career local government officer and was CEO of a Queensland local government during the first year of the pandemic.
    </p>
    <p>
      This handbook is presented in three sections:
      <ul>
        <li>The <a href="/Overview/overview.html"><b>overview</b></a> outlines the progress of the pandemic and how councils and others responded.</li>
        <li>The <a href="/Case_Studies/caseStudies.html"><b>Council Case Studies</b></a> profile five Queensland councils that each faced a different COVID-19 environment.</li>
        <li>The <a href="Framework/Framework.html"><b>Pandemic Management Framework</b></a> provides a matrix of best practice mitigation and response activities and includes templates and reference material.  This section is designed to assist local government practitioners.</li>
      </ul>
